# Permanent Auras are those that stay in one spot; it is not attached to a player, but rather a location.
# aura-name is the name of an aura defined in auras.yml.
# I would recommend using the "/aura admin" command to manage this file though.
#
# If aura-name represents an aura with potion effects, the potion effect is given to EVERYONE within radius,
# unless the effect target is "hostile" or "none"
#spawn-aura:
