# These are the pre-configured auras.
# Players can toggle auras through /aura <aura name>
# Example: /aura jumper
#
# Players can only use an aura if they have the permission for it: uap.aura.<aura-name>
# For example, to use the aura "fastminer", players will need the permission: uap.aura.fastminer
# Players can see a list of auras that they have through /aura
#
# Feel free to remove/add your own auras, but try to ensure that the properties for each shape stays.
# Available aura appearance types:
# none, helix, forcefield, star, circle, whirl
#
# Trying to add auras but not quite sure where to start?
# Check the templates.yml file.
